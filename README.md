# MathMotor Video

MathMotor Video is a local-first Android video editor with a CapCut-inspired workflow. Normal editing runs on-device; AI generation, AI scoring and paid cloud APIs are outside the current product scope.

## Editing flow

1. Choose one video from the phone, or open an empty editor.
2. Use the timeline to add clips, select/reorder them, trim their start/end, split clips and move clips earlier or later.
3. Add text layers with timing, position, size, colour and style controls.
4. Add background music and/or a sound effect; adjust levels and effect start time.
5. Preview the result, choose source resolution, 720p or 1080p, and export an MP4 to Movies/MathMotorVideo.
6. Save/reopen an editable JSON project; local draft autosave stores the playhead, zoom and timeline scroll for resume.

The editor uses Android's document picker and AndroidX Media3 for playback/export. Video files are processed locally; no account or cloud upload is required for normal editing.

## Release baseline and version 395 gate

- User-confirmed installed baseline: **versionCode 394, release/build 61 (app-v8.3-61)**.
- **Version 395 must not be created, signed, published, or offered for update until every required fix below is implemented and verified.**
- README checklist updates and source commits do not themselves mean a feature is fixed or included in an APK.
- Do not bump `versionCode` or `versionName` during this work until the release gate is met and the user explicitly authorizes the release.
- A successful source build is not the same as a tested, published APK. Keep the original media safe; export to a new file.

## Progress reality check — 2026-10-28

**Honest assessment: recent work has not yet produced a newly verified, user-facing improvement that we can confidently call finished.** The project is not starting from zero: editing/export code and earlier focused checks exist. But repeated CI/emulator failures mean we have spent too much time cycling through test failures without closing the main phone-use problems. From the user's perspective, progress has therefore felt stalled; that concern is justified.

### What the latest runs actually prove

- Run [#269 — SUCCESS](https://github.com/agabeyayd-lgtm/MathMotorVideo-Restore/actions/runs/40680915280) on `fix/editor-395-gate`, head `8c78d8e`: unit tests, Debug APK build, and all **19 Android instrumentation tests** passed; emulator screenshots/diagnostics were uploaded as [artifact 12813448192](https://github.com/agabeyayd-lgtm/MathMotorVideo-Restore/actions/runs/40680915280/artifacts/12813448192). This is real automated interaction-test progress on the candidate branch, but it does not by itself prove the interface visually matches CapCut or replace a physical-phone review.
- Run [#270 — FAILED](https://github.com/agabeyayd-lgtm/MathMotorVideo-Restore/actions/runs/40682611758) on separate branch `work/focused-instrumentation-gates`: unit tests and Debug APK build passed, but emulator interaction failed with `androidx.test.uiautomator.StaleObjectException`. It is a test failure to investigate on that branch, not a release-candidate failure and not proof by itself that an editor feature is broken or fixed.
- Keep the distinction clear: #269 is a successful candidate-branch automated test run; visual CapCut resemblance and physical-device usability remain unverified. Version 395 remains blocked.

### How progress will be counted from here

- Report three states separately: **implemented in source**, **automated test passed**, and **verified in actual device use**.
- A test-harness fix or a passing build is engineering progress, but it does not close a user-facing editor requirement.
- Before rerunning a red test, inspect its failing assertion/log and compare with prior failures. Fix the identified cause first; avoid rerunning the same unchanged failure just to get another result.
- After each fix, record the exact behavior changed, the specific test evidence, and what remains unverified. Do not mark a feature done from screenshots or source presence alone.
- The next meaningful milestone is not “more green CI”: it is a repeatable, evidenced interaction/export/save-reopen flow that closes at least one of the open user-facing blockers listed below.
- Version 395 remains blocked. No version bump, signed release APK, publication, or update offer until the release gate passes and the user authorizes it.

## Current baseline capabilities (present in source; not all are proven reliable)

- [x] Multi-clip timeline and clip selection/reordering controls exist.
- [x] Clip trim/split controls and timeline time/pixel mapping logic exist.
- [x] Text layer controls for timing and appearance exist in the source.
- [x] Background music/sound-effect controls exist in the source.
- [x] Editable JSON project save/reopen and local draft autosave are implemented in the source.
- [x] MP4 export path exists in the source.
- [ ] These checkmarks describe existing code paths only; they do **not** certify that the current build behaves correctly on a device. See the required verification checklist below.

## Required work for the next release (395) — NOT DONE until verified

### Timeline touch, scrolling and playhead

- [ ] Make one-finger interactions reliable: select clips, scroll the timeline and drag trim handles without gesture conflicts.
- [ ] Implement reliable two-finger timeline zoom; keep the time under the gesture anchor as stable as possible.
- [ ] Fix the timeline appearing locked to the left; allow moving across the full timeline in both directions and reaching the beginning/end after zooming.
- [ ] Make the playhead behave like CapCut: timeline moves beneath a stationary playhead during scrubbing; preview follows the exact time; playback stays synchronized; split uses the playhead time.
- [ ] Keep time-to-pixel mapping correct after scroll, zoom, trim, clip reorder and multi-clip edits.
- [ ] Keep one unified timeline track/ruler only; do not show a duplicate second timeline or a separate duration/zoom strip. The assembled clip sequence is the single source of truth for total duration.
- [ ] Make ruler labels adapt automatically to pinch zoom: show coarser minute/large-interval marks when zoomed out, switch to seconds as the user zooms in, and increase second-level spacing/detail at closer zoom levels. Keep labels readable, evenly spaced and synchronized with the actual time-to-pixel scale; do not require manual unit selection.
- [ ] Remove or simplify the separate “project duration” UI if it duplicates/conflicts with the actual timeline; preserve any technical export limit only if genuinely needed and explain it clearly.

### Shared timeline coordinate system for every editing layer

- [ ] Use the single main timeline ruler and one shared time-to-pixel coordinate system for video clips, text overlays, music, sound effects, playhead and trim boundaries. Do not give text/audio separate rulers or independent zoom scales.
- [ ] When the user scrolls or pinches to zoom, every visible layer must remain aligned to the same timestamps; existing start/end times must not drift or change just because the zoom level changed.
- [ ] Text and audio start/end points must be directly adjustable on their own lanes against the shared ruler, with accurate snapping/placement where supported. Preview and playback must show each layer only during its defined time range.
- [ ] Verify shared alignment at multiple zoom levels, after scrolling/seeking, clip trim/split/reorder, and after saving/reopening a project.

### Thumbnails

- [ ] Increase thumbnail height/visibility and use enough thumbnails to visually cover the clip; for a 10-second clip, aim for a dense, evenly spaced filmstrip comparable to common mobile editors, not a fixed arbitrary count.
- [ ] Increase the visible width/size of timeline thumbnails so the action in each frame is understandable; prioritize the visible viewport and avoid overly narrow frame tiles.
- [ ] Improve thumbnail generation/loading latency: prioritize frames currently on screen, prepare nearby frames next, cache results and keep scrolling/gestures responsive while extraction continues.
- [ ] Ensure each thumbnail is extracted from its own timestamp so consecutive thumbnails do not all show the same frame.
- [ ] Reduce black placeholders and loading delay; show a useful loading state and replace placeholders promptly as frames become available.
- [ ] Cache/reuse extracted frames and avoid blocking timeline scrolling or editing while thumbnails are prepared.

### Text, audio and undo/redo

- [ ] Make text start/end time editable and ensure the text timeline strip can be trimmed at both ends.
- [ ] Make text size reliably adjustable; preview updates immediately and exported output matches the preview.
- [ ] Verify text timing, placement, size and style remain correct after seeking, zooming, saving/reopening and exporting.
- [ ] Verify Undo/Redo works for all supported edit operations, including text add/delete/timing/size, audio/music changes, clip trim/split/reorder/move; do not show a control for an operation that is not actually undoable.
- [ ] Ensure undo/redo restores both timeline state and preview consistently.

### UI and controls

- [ ] Remove the entire separate bottom timeline-control strip that contains the duplicate duration readout, green zoom slider and +/- zoom buttons; keep time information in one clear timeline location.
- [ ] Implement CapCut-style pinch gestures: two fingers spread to zoom in and pinch together to zoom out. Zoom must operate on the actual timeline/filmstrip, preserve a sensible gesture anchor and remain smooth; do not rely on a visible zoom slider or +/- buttons.
- [ ] Remove the visible "Klip 1" / "Klip 2" labels from the timeline; use the reclaimed space to enlarge the video preview area where possible. Preserve clear clip boundaries and clip selection without those labels.
- [ ] Remove timeline navigation/scroll/zoom arrow buttons entirely. Follow CapCut's direct-touch approach: one-finger drag/swipe for timeline interaction, pinch with two fingers to zoom, tap to select clips, and drag trim handles. Keep only functional visual affordances such as the playhead and trim handles; do not replace the arrows with another row of navigation buttons.
- [ ] Keep controls compact and balanced while retaining accessible touch targets and all existing actions.
- [ ] When a bottom tool such as Edit, Audio, Text or Export is selected, replace the four-item bottom dock with that tool's own controls in the same bottom panel. Do not open the tool menu underneath/behind the preview. Provide a clear back/confirm route to restore the four-item dock when the task is finished.
- [ ] Make the two-video join/add-clip area visually clear and uncluttered after removing timeline arrow buttons and clip labels; do not remove or change the underlying add, order or join functionality.
- [ ] Give the preview the space reclaimed from redundant labels and oversized controls; keep the preview and timeline responsive on small screens.

- [ ] Simplify the home screen: remove redundant menus and explanatory clutter; prioritize choosing/opening a video and entering the editor.
- [ ] Make the home screen and editor responsive to small screens, available height and the software keyboard; controls must remain reachable and not overlap.
- [ ] Remove redundant scissors icons. Reserve scissors for cut/split actions; make trim, split, delete and other actions visually distinct.
- [ ] Keep controls concise, consistently placed, accessible and functional rather than duplicating the same action in multiple places.

### Required validation before version 395

- [ ] Run unit tests for timeline mapping, trim bounds, playhead-to-clip mapping and text timing.
- [ ] Run an interactive Android emulator test covering one-finger scroll/trim, two-finger zoom, playhead scrubbing/sync, thumbnail variety/loading, text timing/size, undo/redo and home-screen navigation.
- [ ] Test with a 10-second video and a multi-clip sequence; check the beginning, middle and end of the timeline at multiple zoom levels.
- [ ] Export an MP4 and verify video, text, audio, duration and playhead cut position; confirm the original input video is unchanged.
- [ ] Save a project, close/reopen it and verify clips, text, audio, duration, zoom and timeline position.
- [ ] Review emulator screenshots and logs; fix regressions and rerun failed checks.
- [ ] Perform a final physical-device smoke test when possible.
- [ ] Only after every required item is complete and verified, prepare version 395. Until then, do not bump the app version or publish an APK.

## Verification boundaries

- Existing unit tests cover some timeline time/pixel mapping, clip trim bounds, playhead-to-clip mapping and text timing boundaries.
- The current emulator screenshot workflow builds a debug APK and captures screens, but its script does not by itself prove all touch gestures, exports, Undo/Redo or save/reopen flows work. Add/run interaction-level tests rather than treating screenshots alone as acceptance.
- Record a checkbox as complete only after the corresponding behavior is implemented and its relevant test passes. If a test cannot be run, leave the item unchecked and say so.
- This repository is a reconstruction from recoverable project files, not an exact recovery of the old V7 source tree.


## Latest technical update — 2026-10-30

- Fresh mainline candidate run [#329](https://github.com/agabeyayd-lgtm/MathMotorVideo-Restore/actions/runs/41040492815) completed with unit tests and Debug APK build passing, but the emulator interaction suite failed 2 of 20 tests. Both failures were right-edge trim gestures that left the project at 8,000 ms.
- Root cause identified from the view hierarchy and failed interaction path: the fixed playhead is a 40 dp-wide overlay brought to the front above the timeline lanes. When the clip's right edge is centered beneath the playhead, the overlay receives the touch before the right trim handle, so the trim handler never gets ACTION_DOWN.
- Source fix committed to the candidate branch: the playhead overlay now yields an initial touch to a visible clip trim handle when the touch point falls inside that handle's on-screen bounds. Playhead dragging remains unchanged elsewhere.
- Added instrumentation assertions to both right-trim interaction paths. They now verify that the trim handle receives both its DOWN and UP events before verifying the duration change; this distinguishes touch routing from trim math.
- Candidate commits: source fix `cbe72383fd080989563e70e6bd184e4f84ec6c9a`; interaction assertions `b2bcdee7c598fe380adbc668cb43667943fa566d`.
- The fix is **implemented in candidate source but not yet verified by a fresh CI run or physical-device test**. Keep the corresponding checklist items open until the new emulator run passes. Version 395 remains blocked; do not change version metadata, sign or publish an APK, or enable the updater.
